=======================
Student Update Reminder
=======================

When updating student names, ensure that you use their names as listed in **Moodle**,
not the names from the Google Sheet. This is crucial for consistency and accuracy.

Note: The code is designed to function correctly as long as it matches the
students' **last names** in both the Google Sheet and Moodle. Even if the first
names in the Google Sheet differ from those in Moodle, the code will still work
because it processes based on **last names**.

**Important Reminder:** Remove students from the Google Sheet if their names appear more than once, as this may assign
incorrect values to a student.
